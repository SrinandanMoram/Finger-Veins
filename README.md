## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/finger-vein-recognition.git
   cd finger-vein-recognition
   ```

2. **Set up environment with Python 3.7** (you can use \[virtualenv]):

Let me know if:
- You want a `requirements.txt` file created from your current environment.
- You want instructions for packaging it into an `.exe`.
- You’re using a GUI framework like `tkinter` (to mention it explicitly).

Ready to generate any of that!
